# Election_Analysis
Python and VS Code
## Project Overview
An analysis of Colorado's recent local congressional election results between three main counties.

1. Calculate the number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. Calculate the percentage of the votes cast for each candidate.
5. Determine the winning of the election by popular vote.
6. Determine the county with the largest voter turnout.

### Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.0, Visual Stucio Code, 1.50.0

### Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham: They recievbed 23.0% of the votes and 85,213 votes.
    - Diana DeGette: They received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: They recieved 3.1% of the votes and 11,606 votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Diane DeGette

### Challenge Overivew
- Learning both Python and VS code was the most enjoyable exercise so far. The    keywords specific to Python and the format was a lot more user-friendly, in my opinion. 

- Setting up the csv file. I did update the data through text to columns options and then saved the file as a csv file. It made it easier for read and decipher when updating the python code. The going through the module was very well written and walked through the steps of pulling the information from the csv file. Then, initializing the data as well. Walking through the steps of tracking both the candidates and voting information before converting the file into a list of dictionaries was interesting and something I will try with the my subroutine for excel, going forward. It also needs to be set up before opening the file as well. Building the code to eventually set up a results format and steps for first the election results, then the candidate code, and then the county was very organized in the approach. Then generating the results in a text file and formatting the information to make it more organized was a little bit of a challenge with spacing. It was a good exercise for practice because of that challenge, though. Where I ran into some issues where indentifying the correct county tracking versus the candidate tracking. After providing a little more detail in the county tracking it corrected the code. Where I also ran into an road-black was reconnecting VS code to my Election_Analysis folder after saving and closing. Now I have more knowledge of how to do that and feel more comfortable with the process. 

- Overall, the module itself was very informative and valuable and can definitely see myself using this in my professional life going forward. 

### Challenge Summary

- The Colorado local congressional election results had an overwhelming winner, Diane DeGette. They had 74% of the overall votes. Denver had the largest voter turnout, which makes sense because it's the largest of the three cities. It also was where Diane DeGette received the majority of that city's votes. There were 87% of Denver's total votes. The results and comparison seems to have overwhelming support from many people.
